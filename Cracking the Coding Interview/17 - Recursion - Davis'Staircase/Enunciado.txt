Davis has "s" staircases in his house and he likes to climb each staircase
1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. Being a very precocious child, he wonders how
many ways there are to reach the top of the staircase.

Given the respective heights for each of the  staircases in his house, find
and print the number of ways he can climb each staircase on a new line.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer, "s", denoting the number of
staircases in his house.
Each line "i" of the "s" subsequent lines contains a single integer, "n",
denoting the height of staircase .

Constraints
* 1 <= s <= 5
* 1 <= n <= 36

Subtasks
1 <= n <= 20  for 50% of the maximum score.

Output Format
For each staircase, print the number of ways Davis can climb it in a new line.

Sample Input
3
1
3
7

Sample Output
1
4
44

Explanation
Let's calculate the number of ways of climbing the first two of the 
Davis' s = 3 staircases:

1. The first staircase only has n = 1 step, so there is only one way for
   him to climb it (i.e., by jumping  step). Thus, we print  on a new line.
2. The second staircase has n = 3 steps and he can climb it in any of the
   four following ways:
   1. 1 -> 1 -> 1
   2. 1 -> 2
   3. 2 -> 1
   4. 3
Thus, we print 4 on a new line.
