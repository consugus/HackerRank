The school term starts soon, and the students need to be sorted into their respective
sections. There are "n" students numbered 1 to n, and "m" sections numbered 1 to m.

Section i needs to have exactly a[i] students. To simplify the process, the school
has decided to assign students to sections in increasing student number, which means
the first a[i] students will be assigned section 1, the next a[2] students will be
assigned section 2, and so on.

Your student number is "k". Which section will you be assigned to?

Complete the function |whichSection| which takes in two integers "n" and "k" and an
integer array a = [a1, a2, .., am ] and returns the section number you will be
assigned to, assuming you are student number .

Input Format
    * The first line of input contains "t", the number of scenarios.
    * The description of "t" scenarios follow, each described in two lines: 
        - The first line contains three space-separated integers "n", "k" and "m".
        - The second line contains "m" space-separated integers a1, a2, .., am.

Constraints
    * 1 <= t <= 250
    * 1 <= k <= n <= 500
    * 1 <= m <= 500
    * 1 <= ai <= n
    * a1 + a2 + .. + am = n

Output Format
For each scenario, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the
section in which student number "k" will be assigned to.

Sample Input 0
1
470 143 5
11 24 420 6 9

Sample Output 0
3

Explanation 0
There are n = 470 students, and there are 5 sections with sizes
[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] = [11, 24, 420, 6, 9]. This means that:

    * Students 1 to 11 get assigned section 1.
    * Students 12 to 35 get assigned section 2.
    * Students 36 to 455 get assigned section 3.
    * Students 456 to 461 get assigned section 4.
    * Students 462 to 470 get assigned section 5.
Since you are student k = 143, you get assigned section 3.
