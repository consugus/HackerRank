In a new version of the game Minute to Win It, the math round involves manipulating
arrays to meet the given condition. In the challenge, you are given an array of "n"
numbers [a0, a1, .., an-1] and an integer "k". In one minute, you can change any
element of the array to any integer you want. Find the minimum amount of time you
have to spend so that the following condition is satisfied:
        for all i from 1 to n-1, a[i] - a[i-1] = k.

For example, consider the array [1, 2, 5] and k = 2. Then the condition can be
satisfied in 1 minute by replacing the 2 with a 3.

Complete the function |minuteToWinIt| which accepts an array "a" of "n" integers
and an integer "k" as input and returns the minimum amount of time in minutes.

Input Format
    * The first line contains two space-separated integers "n" and "k".
    * The second line contains the array in the form of "n" space-separated integers
      a[0], a[1], .., a[n-1].

Constraints
    * 2 <= n <= 100.000
    * |k| <= 100.000
    * a[i] <= 100.000

Output Format
Print the minimum number of minutes needed to reorder the array.

Sample Input 0
6 2
1 2 5 7 9 85

Sample Output 0
2

Explanation 0
The given array is [1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 85]. If we change 2 -> 3 and 85 -> 11 at index 1
and 5 respectively, we get the desired array [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11].
