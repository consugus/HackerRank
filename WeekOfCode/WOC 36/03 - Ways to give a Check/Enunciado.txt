In this problem, the task is to implement a very simple pawn promotion
component that can be used in a chess engine.

For clarity, White promotes the Pawn by moving it from the 7-th to the 8-th
rank(row) along the same file (column). There are 4 possible different
promotions: the pawn can be promoted either to a Queen, or to a Rook, or to a Bishop, or to a Knight.

Note:
* You should assume that there is no position on the board in which the Pawn
  can be moved to the 8-rank by capturing the Black's piece (A diagonal move).
* Moves resulting in a checkmate also count.

Moreover, White can have more than one Pawn in the 7-th rank, but there will
be exactly one that can be promoted with a single valid move. In other words,
there might be more White's Pawns in the 7-th rank, but only one can make a
valid move along its file to the 8-rank. Your task is to find the number of
ways to promote the white pawn in the 7-th rank, to the right piece (Queen,
Rook, or Bishop, or Knight) to give a check to Black's King.

Complete the function "waysToGiveACheck" that takes a 2-D char array as input,
describing the positions of various pieces on the board, and return an integer
denoting the number of ways to end up in a check scenario.

Input Format
In the first line, there is a single integer "t" denoting the number of
scenarios to handle. After that, descriptions of subsequent scenarios are
given.

Each scenario consists of 8 lines, with 8 characters each. The first line
denotes the 8-th rank (row) on the board, while the last line denotes the 
1-st rank. Empty cells on the board are denoted by "#", while pieces are
denoted by characters {KQNBRP} for White's pieces and {kqnbrp} for Black's
pieces, where K/k is the King,  Q/qis a Queen, N/n is a Knight, B/b is a
Bishop, R/r is a Rook, and P/p is a Pawn).

Constraints
* 1 <= t <= 5
* There are at most 4 pieces of each color on the board
* Each player has exactly one King and the given position on the board is a
  valid chess position assuming that it's White's move
* It is guaranteed that White has exactly one Pawn in the 7-th rank that can
  be promoted in a single move

Output Format
Print exactly "t" lines. In the i-th of them, print a single integer denoting
the answer to the i-th scenario, i.e. the number of ways to promote the pawn resulting in a check in this scenario.

In the sample input, there are two cases to solve.
In the first of them, if White promotes the Pawn to a Knight, he gives a
check to the Black King. Any other promotion, i.e. to neither a Queen nor to
a Rook nor to a Bishop doesn't result in a check.

In the second case, if White can promote either to a Queen or to a Bishop in order to give a check to the Black King across a diagonal.
