A relay race is being organised in a school for middle school students by
two high school students, Mason and Madison. Mason starts with the baton
and Madison receives the baton at the final destination. There are middle
school students in between Mason and Madison, and each of their heights
is given. Mason's height , too, is given. Initially, the baton is with
Mason and it is passed to the destination in a manner similar to a relay
race.

1) At any moment, the current baton carrier has an option to hand over the
   baton to the student at the current position or to continue to the next
   position. However, if the student at the given position is taller than
   the current baton carrier, it is mandatory to hand over the baton because
   it is a safer option according to Mason.

2) It takes one second to move between consecutive positions.

3) Whenever the baton is handed over, there is a time and price associated
   with it.

4) The time taken, in seconds, is the absolute difference between the
   heights of the current baton carrier and the student to whom the baton is
   handed.

5) The student to whom the baton is passed charges a given price.

Note: Price charged by a baton carrier can be negative too.

The baton must be sent to Madison in the minimum possible sum of time and
price. Complete the function Solve which takes the number of middle school
students, Mason's height, and heights and prices charged by middle school
students as input, and return the minimum possible sum of time and price
required for the baton to reach Madison.

        Also, note that no handover takes place once the baton has
        reached the destination.

Input Format
Each input consists of four lines. The first line contains the integer "N",
where "N-1" denotes the number of middle school students. 
The second line contains the integer "h", denoting Mason's height. The
third line consists of "N-1" integers, denoting the height of each middle
school student. The last line consists of "N-1" integers, denoting price
charged by each middle school student.

Constraints
* 1 < N <= 100.000
* 0 <= Hi <= 10^9
* 0 <= h <= 10^9
* -10^9 <= Pi <= 10^9

Output Format
The output contains one single integer denoting the required minimum sum of
time and price in which the baton can be sent to Madison.

Here, Mason's height is 5.

In the optimal case first the baton is passed to the "2nd" student.

        exchange time =abs(6-5) = 1 second
        baton has moved 2 places , so another 2 seconds
        Total time = 3 seconds
        The price charged = 3
Then, the second student takes it to the destination.
        baton has moved 2 places , so another 2 seconds
Total time taken = 3 seconds + 2 seconds = 5 seconds
Total Price = 3
Sum = 3 + 5 = 8
