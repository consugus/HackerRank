We say that a string, "s", contains the word |hackerrank| if a subsequence
of the characters in spell the word hackerrank. For example, haacckkerrannkk
does contain |hackerrank|, but haacckkerannk does not (the characters all
appear in the same order, but it's missing a second "r").

More formally, let p0, p1, ..., p9 be the respective indices of
h, a, c, k, e, r, r, a, n, k in string "s". If p0 < p1 < p2< ... < p9 is
true, then "s" contains hackerrank.

You must answer "q" queries, where each query consists of a string, "s". For
each query, print YES on a new line if "s" contains hackerrank; otherwise,
print NO instead.

Input Format
    * The first line contains an integer denoting  (the number of queries).
    * Each line of the "q" subsequent lines contains a single string
      denoting "s".

Constraints
* 2 <= q <= 100
* 10 <= length(s) <= 10000

Output Format
For each query, print |YES| on a new line if s[i] contains hackerrank;
otherwise, print |NO| instead.

Explanation 0
We perform the following  queries:
1. s = "HereiAmstaCKERRANK"
   The characters of hackerrank are in uppercase in the string above.
   Because the string contains all the characters in hackerrank in the same
   exact order as they appear in |hackerrank|, we print |YES| on a new line.
2. s = ""HACKERwoRld does not contain the last three characters of
   hackerrank, so we print |NO| on a new line.
