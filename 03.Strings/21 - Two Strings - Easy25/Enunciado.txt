Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring
may be as small as one character.

Input Format
    * The first line contains a single integer "p", the number of test cases.
    * There will be  pairs of lines following:
        - The first line contains string s1.
        - The second line contains string s2.

Constraints
    * "a" and "b" consist of characters in the range ascii[a-z].
    * 1 <= p <= 10
    * 1 <= |s1|, |s2| <= 100.000

Output Format
For each pair of strings, print |YES| on a new line if the two strings share
a common substring. Otherwise, print |NO| on a new line.

Sample Input
2
hello
world
hi
world

Sample Output
YES
NO

Explanation
We have p = 2 pairs to check:
    1. s1 = "hello", s2 = "world". The substrings "o" and "l" are
       common to both strings.
    2. s1 = "hi", s2 = "world". s1 and s2 share no common substrings.
