A numeric string, "s", is beautiful if it can be split into a sequence of
two or more positive integers, a1, a2, ..., a(n), satisfying the following
conditions:

1. a(i) - a(i-1) = 1 for any 1 <= i <= n (i.e., each element in the sequence
   is  more than the previous element).
2. No a(i) contains a leading zero. For example, we can split  into the
  sequence {1, 02, 03}, but it is not beautiful because 02 and 03 have
  leading zeroes.
3. The contents of the sequence cannot be rearranged. For example, we can
   split s = 312 into the sequence {3, 1, 2}, but it is not beautiful
   because it breaks our first constraint (i.e., 1 - 3 != 1).
The diagram below depicts some beautiful strings:

        see image.png

You must perform "q" queries, where each query consists of some string "s".
For each query, print whether or not the string is beautiful on a new line.
If it's beautiful, print |YES x|, where "X" is the first number of the
increasing sequence (if there are multiple such values of "X", choose the
smallest); otherwise, print |NO| instead.

Input Format
    * The first line contains an integer denoting "Q" (the number of strings
      to evaluate).
    * Each of the "Q" subsequent lines contains some string "S" for a query.

Constraints
* 1 <= Q <= 10
* 1 <= |S| <= 32
* Each character in  is a decimal digit from 0 to 9 (inclusive).

Output Format
For each query, print its answer on a new line (i.e., either | YES x| where 
is the smallest first number of the increasing sequence, or |NO|).

Explanation 0
The first three numbers are beautiful (see the diagram above). The remaining
numbers are not beautiful:

* For S = 101103, all possible splits violate the first and/or second
  conditions.
* For S = 010203, it starts with a zero so all possible splits violate the
  second condition.
* For S = 13, the only possible split is {1,3}, which violates the first
  condition.
* For S = 1, there are no possible splits because "s" only has one digit.
