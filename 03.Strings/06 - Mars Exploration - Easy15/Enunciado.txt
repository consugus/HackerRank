Sami's spaceship crashed on Mars! She sends "n" sequential SOS messages to
Earth for help.

see NASA_Mars_Rover.jpg

Letters in some of the |SOS| messages are altered by cosmic radiation during
transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string, "s", determine
how many letters of Sami's SOS have been changed by radiation.

Input Format
    * There is one line of input: a single string, "s".

Note: As the original message is just |SOS| repeated "n" times, s's length
will be a multiple of 3.

Constraints
    * 1 <= | s | <= 99
    * | s | % 3 = 0
    * s will contain only uppercase English letters.

Output Format
Print the number of letters in Sami's message that were altered by cosmic
radiation.

Sample Input 0
SOSSPSSQSSOR

Sample Output 0
3

Explanation 0

 s = SOSSPSSQSSOR, and signal length |s| = 12. Sami sent 4 |SOS| messages
 (i.e.: 12 / 3 = 4).

Expected signal: SOSSOSSOSSOS
Recieved signal: SOSSPSSQSSOR

We print the number of changed letters, which is 3.

Sample Input 1
SOSSOT

Sample Output 1
1

Explanation 1
s = SOSSOT, and signal length |s| = 6. Sami sent 2 SOS messages
(i.e.: 6 / 3 = 2).

Expected Signal: SOSSOS 
Received Signal: SOSSOT

We print the number of changed letters, which is 1.
