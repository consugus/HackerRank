DNA is a nucleic acid present in the bodies of living things. Each piece of
DNA contains a number of genes, some of which are beneficial and increase
the DNA's total health. Each gene has a health value, and the total health
of a DNA is the sum of the health values of all the beneficial genes that
occur as a substring in the DNA. We represent genes and DNA as non-empty
strings of lowercase English alphabetic letters, and the same gene may
appear multiple times as a susbtring of a DNA.

Given the following:
    * An array of beneficial gene strings, genes = [g0, g1, ..., gn-1]. Note
      that these gene sequences are not guaranteed to be distinct.
    * An array of gene health values, health = [h0, h1, ..., hn-1], where
      each h[i] is the health value for gene h[i].
    * A set of "s" DNA strands where the definition of each strand has three
      components, "first", "last", and "d", where string "d" is a DNA for
      which genes g[start], ..., g[end] are healthy.

Find and print the respective total healths of the unhealthiest (minimum
total health) and healthiest (maximum total health) strands of DNA as two
space-separated values on a single line.

Input Format
    * The first line contains an integer, "n", denoting the total number of
      genes.
    * The second line contains "n" space-separated strings describing the
      respective values of g0, g1, ..., gn-1 (i.e., the elements of "genes").
    * The third line contains "n" space-separated integers describing the
      respective values of h0, h1, ..., hn-1 (i.e., the elements of "health").
    * The fourth line contains an integer, "s", denoting the number of
      strands of DNA to process.
    * Each of the "s" subsequent lines describes a DNA strand in the form
      |start end d|, denoting that the healthy genes for DNA strand "d" are
      g[start], ..., g[end]  and their respective correlated health values
      are h[start], ..., h[end].

Constraints
    * 1 <= n, s <= 10^5
    * 0 <= h[i] <= 10^7
    * 0 <= first <= last < n
    * 1 <= the sum of the lengths of all genes and DNA strands <= 2.10^6
    * It is guaranteed that each g[i] consists of lowercase English
      alphabetic letters only (i.e., a to z).

Output Format
Print two space-separated integers describing the respective total health of
the unhealthiest and the healthiest strands of DNA.

Sample Input 0

0 4 xyz
2 4 bcdybc

Sample Output 0
0 19

Explanation 0
In the diagrams below, the ranges of beneficial genes for a specific DNA on
the left are highlighed in green and individual instances of beneficial
genes on the right are bolded. The total healths of the s = 3 strands are:

        DNA-health-diag1.png

The total health of caaab is 3 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 6 = 19.

        DNA-health-diag2.pgn

The total health of xyz is 0, because it contains no beneficial genes.

        DNA-health-diag3.png

The total health of bcdybc is 3 + 5 + 3 = 11.

The unhealthiest DNA strand is xyz with a total health of 0, and the
healthiest DNA strand is caaab with a total health of 19. Thus, we print
0 19 as our answer.
