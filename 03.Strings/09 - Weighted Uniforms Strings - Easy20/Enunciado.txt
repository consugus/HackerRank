A weighted string is a string of lowercase English letters where each letter
has a weight in the inclusive range from 1 to 26, defined below:

        see image1.png

We define the following terms:

* The weight of a string is the sum of the weights of all the string's
  characters. For example:

        see image2.png

* A uniform string is a string consisting of a single character repeated
  zero or more times. For example, "ccc" and "a" are uniform strings, but
  "bcb" and "cd" are not (i.e., they consist of more than one distinct
  character).

Given a string, "s", let "U" be the set of weights for all possible uniform
substrings (contiguous) of string "s". You have to answer "n" queries, where
each query "i" consists of a single integer, x[i]. For each query, print
|Yes| on a new line if X[i] is an element of set "U"; otherwise, print
|No| instead.

Input Format
* The first line contains a string denoting "s" (the original string).
* The second line contains an integer denoting "n" (the number of queries).
* Each line "i" of the "n" subsequent lines contains an integer denoting
  x[i] (the weight of a uniform subtring of "s" that may or may not exist).

Constraints
* 1 <= |s|, n <= 10^5
* 1 <= x[i] <= 10^7
 * "s" will only contain lowercase English letters.

Output Format
Print "n" lines. For each query, |Yes|print Yes on a new line if x[i] is an
element of "U"; otherwise, print |No| instead.

Explanation 0
The weights of every possible uniform substring in the string abccddde are
shown below:

        see image3.png

We print |Yes| on the first four lines because the first four queries match
weights of uniform substrings of "s". We print |No| for the last two queries
because there are no uniform substrings in "s" that have those weights.

Note that while "de" is a substring of "s" that would have a weight of 9, it
is not a uniform substring.

Note that we are only dealing with contiguous substrings. So ccc is not a
substring of the string ccxxc.
