Dothraki are planning an attack to usurp King Robert's throne. King Robert
learns of this conspiracy from Raven and plans to lock the single door
through which the enemy can enter his kingdom.

        see game-of-thrones.png

But, to lock the door he needs a key that is an anagram of a palindrome. He
starts to go through his box of strings, checking to see if they can be
rearranged into a palindrome.
