Madam Hannah Otto, the CEO of Reviver Corp., is fond of palindromes, or
words that read the same forwards or backwards. She thinks palindromic brand
names are appealing to millennials.

As part of the marketing campaign for the company's new juicer called the
Rotatorâ„¢, Hannah decided to push the marketing team's palindrome-searching
skills to a new level with a new challenge.

In this challenge, Hannah provides a string "s" consisting of lowercase
English letters. Every day, for "q" days, she would select two integers "l"
and "r", take the substring "s[l ... r]" (the substring of "s" from index
"l" to index "r"), and ask the following question:

Consider all the palindromes that can be constructed from some of the
letters from s[l ... r]. You can reorder the letters as you need. Some of
these palindromes have the maximum length among all these palindromes. How
many maximum-length palindromes are there?

For example, if s = "madamimadam", l = 4 and r = 7, then we have,

Your job as the head of the marketing team is to answer all the queries.
Since the answers can be very large, you are only required to find the
answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Complete the functions "initialize" and "answerQuery" and return the number
of maximum-length palindromes modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input Format

    * The first line contains the string "s".
    * The second line contains a single integer "q".
    * The ith of the next "q" lines contains two space-separated integers
      li, ri denoting the "l" and "r" values Anna selected on the ith day.

Constraints
Here, |s| denotes the length of "s".
    * 1 <= |s| <= 100.000
    * 1 <= q <= 100.000
    * 1 <= li <= ri <= |s|

Subtasks
For 30% of the total score:
    * 1 <= |s| <= 100
    * 1 <= q <= 1000
    * ri - li <= 3

For 60% of the total score:
    * 1 <= |s| <= 100
    * 1 <= q <= 1000

Output Format
For each query, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the answer.

On the first day, l = 1 and r = 4. The maximum-length palindromes are "ewe"
and "eke".

On the second day, l = 2 and r = 3. The maximum-length palindrome is "ee".
