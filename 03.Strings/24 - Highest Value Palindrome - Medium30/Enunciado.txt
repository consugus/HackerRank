Palindromes are strings that read the same from the left or right, for
example "madam" or "0110".

You will be given a string representation of a number and a maximum number
of changes you can make. Alter the string, one digit at a time, to create
the string representation of the largest number possible given the limit to
the number of changes. The length of the string may not be altered, so you
must consider 0's left of all higher digits in your tests. For example "0110"
is valid, "0011" is not.

Given a string representing the starting number and a maximum number of
changes allowed, create the largest palindromic string of digits possible or
the string -1 if it's impossible to create a palindrome under the
contstraints.

Complete the "highestValuePalindrome" function which takes 3 arguments, a
string "s", an integer "n" and an integer "k" and returns a string denoting
required palindrome.

Constraints
    * 0 <= n <= 100.000
    * 0 <= k <= 100.000
    * Each character "i" in the number is an integer where 0 <= i <= 9.

Raw Input Format
* The first line contains two space-separated integers, "n" (the number of
   digits in the number) and "k" (the maximum number of changes allowed),
   respectively.
* The second line contains an n-digit string of numbers that you are to
  attempt to make palindromic.

Sample Input 0

3943

Sample Output 0
3993

Explanation 0
There are two ways to make 3943 a palindrome by changing no more than k = 1
digits:

1. 3943 --> 3443
2. 3743 --> 3993
3993 > 3443, so we print 3993.
