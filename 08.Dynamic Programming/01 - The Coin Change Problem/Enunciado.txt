You are working at the cash counter at a fun-fair, and you have different types of
coins available to you in infinite quantities. The value of each coin is already
given. Can you determine the number of ways of making change for a particular number
of units using the given types of coins?

For example, if you have 4 types of coins, and the value of each type is given as
8, 3, 1, 2 respectively, you can make change for 3 units in three ways: {1, 1, 1, },
{1, 3} and {3}.

Complete the function |getWays| that takes the number of coin types and the value of
each coin type as input, and return the number of ways to make change for "n" units
using any number of coins.

Input Format
    * The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective
      values of "n" and "m", where:
        "n"is the number of units
        "m" is the number of coin types
The second line contains "m" space-separated integers describing the respective
values of each coin type : c0, c1mc... , cm-1 (the list of distinct coins available
in infinite amounts).

Constraints
    * 1 <= ci <= 50
    * 1 <= n <= 250
    * 1 <= m <= 50
    * Each ci is guaranteed to be distinct.

Hints
    * Solve overlapping subproblems using Dynamic Programming (DP):
      You can solve this problem recursively but will not pass all the test cases
      without optimizing to eliminate the overlapping subproblems. Think of a way to
      store and reference previously computed solutions to avoid solving the same
      subproblem multiple times. * Consider the degenerate cases:
        - How many ways can you make change for 0 cents? - How many ways can you make
          change for > 0 cents if you have no coins? * If you're having trouble defining
          your solutions store, then think about it in terms of the base case (n = 0).
        - The answer may be larger than a -bit integer.

Output Format
Print a long integer denoting the number of ways we can get a sum of  from the given
infinite supply of types of coins.

Sample Output 0
4

Explanation 0
There are four ways to make change for n = 4 using coins with values given by
C = {1, 2, 3}:
    1. {1, 1, 1, 1}
    2. {1, 1, 2}
    3. {2, 2}
    4. {1, 3}
Thus, we print 4 as our answer.

Sample Output 1
5

Explanation 1
There are five ways to make change for n = 10 units using coins with values given by
C = {2, 5, 3, 6}:
    1. {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
    2. {2, 2, 3, 3}
    3. {2, 2, 6}
    4. {2, 3, 5}
    5. {5, 5}

Thus, we print 5 as our answer.
