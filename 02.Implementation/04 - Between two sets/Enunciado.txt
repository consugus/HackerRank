Consider two sets of positive integers, A = {a0, a1, ..., an-1} and
B = {b0, b1, ..., bn-1}. We say that a positive integer, x, is between
sets A and B if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. All elements in A are factors of x.
2. x is a factor of all elements in B.

In other words, some x is between A and B if that value of x satisfies
xMODai = 0 for every ai in A and also satisfies biMODx = 0 for every bi in B.
For example, if A = {2, 6} and B = {12}, then our possible x values are 6
and 12.

Given A and B, find and print the number of integers (i.e., possible x's)
that are between the two sets.

Input Format
* The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the
  respective values of n (the number of elements in set A) and m (the number
  of elements in set B).
* The second line contains n distinct space-separated integers describing
  a0, a1, ..., an-1.
* The third line contains m distinct space-separated integers describing
  b0, b1, ..., bn-1.

Constraints
* 1 <= n,m <= 10
* 1 <= ai <= 100
* 1<= bi <= 100

Output Format
Print the number of integers that are considered to be between A and B.

Sample Input
2 3
2 4
16 32 96

Sample Output
3

Explanation
There are three x values between A = {2,4} and B = {16, 32, 96}:

* x = 4:
    * All the elements in A evenly divide x = 4.
    * x = 4 evenly divides all the elements in B.
* x = 8:
    * All the elements in A evenly divide 8.
    * x = 8 evenly divides all the elements in B.
* x = 16:
    * All the elements in A evenly divide x = 16.
    * x = 16 evenly divides all the elements in B.

Thus, we print 3 as our answer.
