Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and
ending value describing a range of integers. Sherlock must determine the number of
square integers within that range, inclusive of the endpoints.

Note: A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer,
e.g. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25.

Input Format
    * The first line contains "t", the number of test cases.
    * Each of the next "t" lines contains two space-separated integers denoting "a"
      and "b", the starting and ending integers in the ranges.

Constraints
    * 1 <= t <= 100
    * 1 <= a <= b <= 10^9

Output Format
For each test case, print the number of square integers in the range on a new line.

Sample Input
2
3 9
17 24

Sample Output
2
0

Explanation

Test Case #00: In range [3, 9], 4 and 9 are the two square integers.
Test Case #01: In range [17, 24], there are no square integers.
