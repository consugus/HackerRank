Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their books to a page number. Brie
can either start turning pages from the front of the book or from the back of the
book. She always turns pages one at a time. When she opens the book, page 1 is
always on the right side:

When she flips page 1, she sees pages 2 and 3. Each page except the last page will
always be printed on both sides. The last page may only be printed on the front,
given the length of the book. If the book is "n" pages long, and she wants to turn
to page "p", what is the minimum number of pages she will turn? She can start at
the beginning or the end of the book.

Given "n" and "p", find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in
order to arrive at page .

Input Format
    * The first line contains an integer "n", the number of pages in the book.
    * The second line contains an integer, "p", the page that Brie's teacher wants
      her to turn to.

Constraints
    * 1 <= n <= 10^5
    * 1 <= p <= n

Output Format
Print an integer denoting the minimum number of pages Brie must turn to get to
page "p".

If Brie starts turning from page 1, she only needs to turn 1 page:

If Brie starts turning from page 6, she needs to turn 2 pages:

Because we want to print the minumum number of page turns, we print 1 as our answer.

Sample Input 1
5
4

Sample Output 1

If Brie starts turning from page 1, she needs to turn 2 pages:

If Brie starts turning from page 5, she doesn't need to turn any pages:

Because we want to print the minimum number of page turns, we print 0 as our answer.
