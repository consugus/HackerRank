Madison, is a little girl who is fond of toys. Her friend Mason works in a toy
manufacturing factory. Madison has a 2D board "A" of size HxW with "H" rows and "W"
columns. The board is divided into cells of size 1x1 with each cell indicated by
it's coordinate (i, j). The cell (i, j) has an integer A[i][j] written on it. To
create the toy Madison stacks A[i][j] number of cubes of size 1x1x1 on the cell
(i, j).

Given the description of the board showing the values of a[i][j] and that the price
of the toy is equal to the 3d surface area find the price of the toy.

Input Format
    * The first line contains two space-separated integers "H" and "W" the height
      and the width of the board respectively.
    * The next "H" lines contains "W" space separated integers. The jth integer
      in ith line denotes A[i][j].

Constraints
    * 1 <= H, W <= 100
    * 1 <= A[i][j] <= 100

Output Format
Print the required answer, i.e the price of the toy, in one line.
