Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a
record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record
for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish
her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

For example, assume her scores for the season are represented in the array
score = [12, 24, 10, 24]. Scores are in the same order as the games played. She
would tabulate her results as follows:

                                 Count
Game  Score  Minimum  Maximum   Min Max
 0      12     12       12       0   0
 1      24     12       24       0   1
 2      10     10       24       1   1
 3      24     10       24       1   1
Given Maria's array of "scores" for a season of "n" games, find and print the number
of times she breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

Input Format
    * The first line contains an integer "n", the number of games.
    * The second line contains "n" space-separated integers describing the respective
      values of score[0], score[1], ... score[n-1].

Constraints
    * 1 <= n <= 1000
    * 0 <= score[i] <= 10^8

Output Format
Print two space-seperated integers describing the respective numbers of times her
best (highest) score increased and her worst (lowest) score decreased.

The diagram below depicts the number of times Maria broke her best and worst records
throughout the season:

                Game    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
                Score   10  5   20  20  4   5   2   25  1
        Highest Score   10  10  20  20  20  20  20  25  25
        Lowest Score    10  5   5   5   4   4   2   2   1

She broke her best record twice (after games 2 and 7) and her worst record four times
(after games 1, 4, 6, and 8), so we print |2 4| as our answer. Note that she did not
break her record for best score during game 3, as her score during that game was not
strictly greater than her best record at the time.

The diagram below depicts the number of times Maria broke her best and worst records
throughout the season:

                Game    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
                Score   3   4   21  36  10  28  35  5   24  42
        Highest Score   3   4   21  36  36  36  36  36  36  42
        Lowest Score    3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3

She broke her best record four times (after games 1, 2, 3, and 9) and her worst
record zero times (no score during the season was lower than the one she earned
during her first game), so we print |4 0| as our answer.
