Bob has a strange counter. At the first second, it displays the number 3. Each
second, the number displayed by the counter decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

The counter counts down in cycles. In next second, the timer resets to
2 x InitialNumberForThePriorCycle and continues counting down. The diagram below
shows the counter values for each time  in the first three cycles:

        see strangeCounter.png

Find and print the value displayed by the counter at time "t".

Input Format
    * A single integer denoting the value of "t".

Constraints
    * 1 <= t <= 10^12

Subtask
    * 1 <= t <= 10^5 for 60% of the maximum score.

Output Format
Print the value displayed by the strange counter at the given time "t".

Sample Input
4

Sample Output
6

Explanation
Time t = 4 marks the beginning of the second cycle. It is double the number
displayed at the beginning of the first cycle: 2 x 3 = 6. This is also shown in the 
diagram in the Problem Statement above.
