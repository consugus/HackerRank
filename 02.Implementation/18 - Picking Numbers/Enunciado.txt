Given an array of integers, find and print the maximum number of integers you can
select from the array such that the absolute difference between any two of the chosen
integers is less than or equal to 1. For example, if your array is
a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], you can create two subarrays meeting the criterion:
[1, 1, 2, 2]  and [4, 4, 5, 5, 5]. The maximum length subarray has 5 elements.

Input Format
    * The first line contains a single integer "n", the size of the array "a".
    * The second line contains "n" space-separated integers a[i].

Constraints
    * 2 <= n <= 100
    * 0 < a[i] < 100
    * The answer will be >= 2.
Output Format
A single integer denoting the maximum number of integers you can choose from the
array such that the absolute difference between any two of the chosen integers
is <= 1.

Sample Input 0
6
4 6 5 3 3 1

Sample Output 0
3

Explanation 0
We choose the following multiset of integers from the array: {4, 3, 3}. Each pair in
the multiset has an absolute difference <= 1 (i.e.,|4 - 3| = 1  and |3 - 3| = 0), so
we print the number of chosen integers, 3, as our answer.

Sample Input 1
6
1 2 2 3 1 2

Sample Output 1
5
Explanation 1
We choose the following multiset of integers from the array: {1, 2, 2, 1, 2}. Each
pair in the multiset has an absolute difference <= 1 (i.e., |1 - 2| = 1, |1 - 1| = 0,
and |2 - 2| = 0), so we print the number of chosen integers, 5, as our answer.
