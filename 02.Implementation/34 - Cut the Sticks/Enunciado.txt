You are given a number of sticks of varying lengths. You will iteratively cut the
sticks into smaller sticks, discarding the shortest pieces until there are none
left. At each iteration you will determine the length of the shortest stick remaining,
cut that length from each of the longer sticks and then discard all the pieces of
that shortest length. When all the remaining sticks are the same length, they cannot
be shortened so discard them.

Given the lengths of "n" sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before
each iteration until there are none left.

Note: Before each iteration you must determine the current shortest stick.

Input Format
    * The first line contains a single integer "n".
    * The next line contains "n" space-separated integers: a0, a1,...an-1, where
      a[i] represents the length of the ith stick in array arr.

Output Format
For each operation, print the number of sticks that are cut, on separate lines.

Constraints
    * 1 <= n <= 1000
    * 1 <= a[i] <= 1000
