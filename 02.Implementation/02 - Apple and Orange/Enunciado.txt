Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance
of fruit. In the diagram below, the red region denotes his house, where "s"
is the start point and "t" is the end point. The apple tree is to the left
of his house, and the orange tree is to its right. You can assume the trees
are located on a single point, where the apple tree is at point "a" and the
orange tree is at point .

see picture1.jpg

When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands "d" units of distance from its
tree of origin along the x-axis. A negative value of "d" means the fruit
fell "d" units to the tree's left, and a positive value of "d" means it
falls "d" units to the tree's right.

Given the value of "d" for "m" apples and "n" oranges, can you determine
how many apples and oranges will fall on Sam's house (i.e., in the inclusive
range [s, t])? Print the number of apples that fall on Sam's house as your first line of output, then print the number of oranges that fall on Sam's house as your second line of output.

Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective
values of "s" and "t".
The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective
values of "a" and "b".
The third line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective
values of "m" and "n".
The fourth line contains "m" space-separated integers denoting the respective
distances that each apple falls from point "a".
The fifth line contains "n" space-separated integers denoting the respective
distances that each orange falls from point "b".

Constraints
* 1 <= s, t, a ,b, m ,n <= 10^5
* -10^5 < d <= 10^5
* a < s < t < b

Output Format
Print two lines of output:

1. On the first line, print the number of apples that fall on Sam's house.
2. On the second line, print the number of oranges that fall on Sam's house.

Sample Input 0
7 11   // zona roja de la figura [s, t]
5 15   // ubicaciÃ³n del manzano y del naranjo
3 2    // cantidad de manzanas y cantidad de naranjas
-2 2 1 // distancia a la que cada manzana cae respecto del manzano
5 -6   // distnacia a la que cada naranja cae respecto del naranjo

Sample Output 0
1
1

Explanation 0
The first apple falls at position 5 - 2 = 3.  (a + (-2)) --> XXX
The second apple falls at position 5 + 2 = 7. (a + (+2)) --> dentro de [s, t]
The third apple falls at position 5 + 1 = 6.  (a + (+1)) --> XXX

The first orange falls at position 15 + 5 = 20. (b + (+5)) --> dentro de [s, t]
The second orange falls at position 15 - 6 = 9. (b + (-6)) --> XXX

Only one fruit (the second apple) falls within the region between 7 (s)
and 11 (t), so we print 1 as our first line of output.
Only the second orange falls within the region between 7(s) and 11(t),
so weprint 1 as our second line of output.
