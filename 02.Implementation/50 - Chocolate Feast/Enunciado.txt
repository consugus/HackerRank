price of each chocolate is "c". The store offers a discount: for every "m" package
he gives to the store, he gets a free chocolate. How many Brenno chocolates can he
eat?

Input Format:
    * The first line contains the number "t" of test cases.
    * "t" rows will follow, each containing three integers "n", "c", and "m"

Output Format:
Print the total number of chocolates that Brenno eats.

Restrictions:
    * 2 <= n <= 100.000
    * 1 <= c <= n

Input Sample
3
10 2 5
12 4 4
6 2 2

Output Example
6
3
5

Explanation
    * In the first case, he can buy 5 chocolates for $10 and change the 5 packages
      for 1 more chocolate, so that the total number of chocolates he can eat is 6.

    * In the second case, he can buy 3 chocolates for $12. However, he would need 4
      packages to trade for 1 more chocolate. He can not take advantage of the offer
      and consequently the total number of chocolates remains 3.

    * In the third case, he can buy 3 chocolates for $6 and exchange 2 packages for
      1 more chocolate. After consumption, he exchanges the remaining 2 containers
      for 1 more chocolate, totaling 5.
