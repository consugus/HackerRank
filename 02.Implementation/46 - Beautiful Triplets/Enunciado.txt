Erica wrote an increasing sequence of "n" numbers (a[0], a[1], .. , a[n-1]) in her
notebook. She considers a triplet (a[i], a[j], a[k]) to be beautiful if:
    * i < j < k
    * a[j] - a[i] == a[k] - a[j] = d
Given the sequence and the value of "d", can you help Erica count the number of
beautiful triplets in the sequence?

Input Format
    * The first line contains 2 space-separated integers "n" and "d", the length of
      the sequence and the beautiful difference.
    * The second line contains "n" space-separated integers a[i].

Constraints
    * 1 <= n <= 10^4
    * 1 <= d <= 20
    * 0 <= a[i] <= 2x10^4
    * a[i] > a[i-1]

Output Format
Print a single line denoting the number of beautiful triplets in the sequence.

Sample Input
7 3
1 2 4 5 7 8 10

Sample Output
3
Explanation
Our input sequence is [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10], and our beautiful difference d = 3.
There are many possible triplets (a[i], a[j], a[k]), but our only beautiful triplets
are (1, 4, 7), (4, 7, 10) and (2, 5, 8). Please see the equations below:

    7  - 4 = 4 - 1 = 3 = d
    10 - 7 = 7 - 4 = 3 = d
    8  - 5 = 5 - 2 = 3 = d

Recall that a beautiful triplet satisfies the following equivalence relation:
    a[j] - a[i] = a[k] - a[j] = d where i < j < k.
