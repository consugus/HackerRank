Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for
a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure
is as follows:

    1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will
       be charged i.e.:
            fine = 0
    2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the
       same calendar month and year as the expected return date:
            fine = 15 hackos x # days late
    3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the
       same calendar year as the expected return date:
            fine = 500 hackos x #months late
    4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected,
       there is a fixed fine of:
            fine = 10.000 hackos

Charges are based only on the least precise measure of lateness. For example, whether
a book is due January 1, 2017 or December 31, 2017, if it is returned January 1, 2018,
that is a year late and the fine would be 10.000 hackos.

Input Format
    * The first line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective
      day, month, and  yearon which the book was returned.
    * The second line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective
      day, month, and year on which the book was due to be returned.

Constraints
    * 1 <= dd <= 31
    * 1 <= mm <= 12
    * 1 <= yyyy <= 3000

Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.

Sample Input
9 6 2015
6 6 2015

Sample Output
45

Explanation
Given the following return dates:
Actual: Da = 9, Ma = 6, Ya = 2015
Expected: De = 6, Me = 9, Ye = 2015

Because Ye = Ya, we know it is less than a year late.
Because Me = Ma, we know it's less than a month late.
Because De < Da, we know that it was returned late (but still within the same month
and year).

Per the library's fee structure, we know that our fine will be 15 Hackros x # days
late. We then print the result of 15 x (Da - De) = 15 x (9 - 6) = 45 as our output.
