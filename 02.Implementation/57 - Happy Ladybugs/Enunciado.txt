Happy Ladybugs is a board game having the following properties:

    * The board is represented by a string, "b", of length "n". The ith character of
      the string, b[i], denotes the ith cell of the board.
        - If b[i] is an underscore (i.e., _), it means the ith cell of the board
          is empty.
        - If b[i] is an uppercase English alphabetic letter (ascii[A-Z]), it means
          the ith cell contains a ladybug of color b[i].
        - String "b" will not contain any other characters.
    * A ladybug is happy only when its left or right adjacent cell (i.e., b[i+/-1])
      is occupied by another ladybug having the same color.
    * In a single move, you can move a ladybug from its current position to any
      empty cell. 
Given the values of "n" and "b" for "g" games of Happy Ladybugs, determine if it's
possible to make all the ladybugs happy. For each game, print |YES| on a new line if
all the ladybugs can be made happy through some number of moves. Otherwise, print |NO|.

As an example, b = [YYR_B_BR]. You can move the rightmost B and R to make
b = [YYRRBB__] and all the ladybugs are happy.

Input Format
    * The first line contains an integer "g", the number of games.
    * The next "g" pairs of lines are in the following format:
        - The first line contains an integer "n", the number of cells on the board.
        - The second line contains a string "b" describing the "n" cells of the board.

Constraints
    * 1 <= g, n <= 100
    * b[i] = {_, ascii [A-Z]}

Output Format
For each game, print |YES| on a new line if it is possible to make all the ladybugs
happy. Otherwise, print |NO|.

The four games of Happy Ladybugs are explained below:

    1. Initial board:
            see lady1.png
       After the first move:
            see lady2.png
       After the second move:
            see lady3.png
       After the third move:
            see lady4.png
       Now all the ladybugs are happy, so we print |YES| on a new line.

    2. There is no way to make the ladybug having color Y happy, so we print |NO|
       on a new line.
    3. There are no unhappy ladybugs, so we print |YES| on a new line.
    4. Move the rightmost B and R to form b = [BBRRR__].
