Jonathan is in a science class, but because he does not understand how to
name acids, he would like you to make a program for him. There are two types
of acids at his level, "metal" and "polyatomic".

Conditions for naming an acid:
* If the given input starts with hydro and ends with ic then it is a
  non-metal acid.
* If the input only ends with ic then it is a polyatomic acid.
* If it does not have either case, then output not an acid.
For example, for the input, "hidrochloroic", the correct output is
"non-metal acid" as the input begins with hydro and ends with "ic".

Complete the function "acidNaming" which takes a string input with the name
of the acid, and return a string describing the appropriate type of acid.

Input Format
The first line will contain an integer "q".
The next "q" lines will contain a single word "s".

Constraints
* 1 <= q <= 100
* words "s" is made up of lower case english letters
* 2 <= length of "s" <= 10^4

Output Format
* If the word starts with "hydro" and ends with "ic" then it is a non-metal
  acid. Hence, the correct output is "non-metal acid".

* If the word only ends with "ic" then it is a "polyatomic acid". Hence, the
  correct output is "polyatomic acid".

* If the word does not meet any of the cases, then the correct output is
  "not an acid".

Sample Input 0
    3
    hydrochloric
    rainbowic
    idontevenknow

Sample Output 0
    non-metal acid
    polyatomic acid
    not an acid

Explanation 0
* In the first case, the input begins with "hydro" and ends with "ic", hence,
  the correct output is "non-metal acid".
* In the second case, the input only ends with "ic", hence, the correct
  output is "polyatomic acid".
* The third case, the input neither begins with "hydro" nor ends with "ic",
  hence the correct output is "not an acid".
