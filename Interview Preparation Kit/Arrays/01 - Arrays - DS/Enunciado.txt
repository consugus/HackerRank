An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a
contiguous block of memory. In an array, "a", of size "n", each memory location has
some unique index, "i" (where 0 <= i < n), that can be referenced as a[i].

Given an array, "a", of "n" integers, print each element in reverse order as a
single line of space-separated integers.

Note: If you've already solved our C++ domain's Arrays Introduction challenge, you
may want to skip this.

Input Format
    * The first line contains an integer, "n" (the number of integers in "a").
    * The second line contains "n" space-separated integers describing "a".

Constraints
    * 1 <= n <= 1000
    * 1 <= a[i] <= 10.000, where a[i] is the ith integer in "a"

Output Format
Print all "n" integers in "a" in reverse order as a single line of space-separated
integers.
