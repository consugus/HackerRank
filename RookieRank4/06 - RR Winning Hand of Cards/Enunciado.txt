You're at a party and the host has arranged a game of cards. You are given
a number of cards and try to create as many combinations from those cards
as possible that result in a winning hand. A winning hand is the one where
the product of the numbers on the cards modulo a given value, the modulo
divisor is equal to another given value, the target value.

Complete the function "winningHands" to return an integer denoting the
number of winning hands.

Input Format
Input contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated
integers "n", "m" and "x" denoting the number of cards, the modulo divisor
and the target value respectively. The second line contains "n"
space-separated integers. The ith integer denotes the number written on
card "i".

Constraints
    * 1 <= n <= 30
    * 1 <= m <= 10^6
    * 0 <= x <= (m-1)
    * 1 <= number of cards <= 10^7

Output Format
Print the number of winning hands from the given cards.

Consider the following hands (given by their indices): .
{1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}
* 2 mod 3 = 2
* 2 mod 3 = 2
* 2 mod 3 = 2
* (2x2) mod 3 = 1
* (2x2 mod 3 = 1
* (2x2 mod 3 = 1
* (2x2x2) mod 3 =  2

Four hands have product modulo 3 = 2.
