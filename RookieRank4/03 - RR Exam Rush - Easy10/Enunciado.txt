Your final exam is approaching and you haven't begun to study. In order to
have the best chance of passing the course, you resolve to study from now
until exam time. Chapters vary in length, but not in value towards a passing
grade, so you want to study as many complete chapters as possible. The order
of chapters doesn't matter, but you must complete a chapter before it will
help your grade.

Your task is to maximize the number of complete chapters you can study
between now and exam time.

Complete the function "examRush" to return the integer value representing
the maximum number of chapters you can study before the exam.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer number, "n" (number of chapters) and an
integer number, "t" (hours left until the exam). Then there are "n" lines,
each containing the time, "tm[i]" in hours required to study that chapter.

Constraints
* 1 <= n, tm <= 10^5
* 1 <= t <= 10^9

Output Format
Print an integer number, which is the maximum number of chapters that can be
studied completely before the start of the final examination.

In this situation, you can either study chapter 1 or chapter 2 completely,
but not both.
