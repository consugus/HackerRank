You are appointed as a system admin in a firm, and it is your responsibility
to check the safety of the server racks in one of the server rooms. The
server racks are arranged in an array. If any rack reaches another rack when
it falls, it will cause the other rack to fall. Safety rules require that at
least some of the racks should remain standing if one of the ends falls
toward the others.

Your task is to determine whether either or both ends will cause all racks
to fall should one be tipped. To determine if a rack will knock over another
rack, use the following two rules*:

1. Left rack falls: position[i] + h[i] >= position[i_to_test]
2. Right rack falls:  position[i] - h[i] <= position[i_to_test]

* Assume the position of a rack is position[i] and its height is h[i].

The test is based on a single event. In other words, if it takes toppling
both the left and right ends to knock down all the servers, you still pass
the safety inspection.

An example follows:
In the image shown below, rack "R1" can trigger the fall of rack "R2" since
1 + 3 >=4, but rack "R2" can't trigger the fall of rack "R1" since
4 - 2 Not <= 1.

Complete the function "checkAll", which takes the positions and heights of
the server racks as input, and return a string like:
["LEFT", "RIGHT", "BOTH", "NONE"] representing which of the ends is unsafe.

Input Format
In the first line, the number of racks, "n", will be given.
In the second line, the position of each rack, "x[i]", will be given.
In the third line, the height of each rack, "h[i]", will be given.

Constraints
* 0 < n <= 100
* 1 < x[i] <= 1000
* 0 < h[i] <= 1000

Output Format
If the racks fall over no matter from which end it gets triggered, then
return "BOTH". If the racks fall over due to rack at leftmost or rightmost,
then return "LEFT" or "RIGHT" respectively. If neither end toppling will
cause all the racks to fall over, return "NONE".

Sample Input 0
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 1 1 1

Sample Output 0
BOTH

Explanation 0
Each of the piles in this case are situated 1 unit away from each other,
and the height of each pile is also 1 unit. All of the piles will fall over
regardless of the side which is pushed over.

Sample Input 1
5
1 2 3 4 8
1 1 1 1 1

Sample Output 1
NONE

Explanation 1
If the leftmost pile is pushed over, only the first four piles will fall
over. The last pile will remain untouched, as none of the previous ones can
reach it. Similarly, if the rightmost pile is pushed over, it can't reach
any of the others.
